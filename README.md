# Charties - Charts in SwiftUI

This is a package I'm building out of personal need to easily create configurable, reusable, and beautiful charts. I'm starting with a **scatter plot chart**, which is specifically the type of chart I need and was not available in other existing chart packages.

I'll be updating this document with images and general usage documentation as progress is made in the development of the package.
